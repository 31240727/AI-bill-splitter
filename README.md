# ðŸ”¥ Roast Master Bill Splitter

A smart and sassy bill-splitting web app powered by LLM magic. Enter your friends' names, the total bill, who paid, and the roast intensityâ€”and let AI calculate the shares and roast the freeloaders while itâ€™s at it.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

Roast Master leverages a language model API (DeepSeek) to generate dynamic, personalized roast comments for each participant based on:
- Total bill amount
- People involved
- The payer
- Roast intensity (Playful or Savage)

The app sends a structured prompt to the LLM API, and then:
- Calculates fair splits
- Retrieves roast replies for each person
- Displays everything in a fun, user-friendly interface
