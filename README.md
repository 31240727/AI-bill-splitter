# ðŸ”¥ AI BILL SPLITTER

A smart and sassy bill-splitting web app powered by LLM magic. Enter your friends' names, the total bill, who paid, and the roast intensityâ€”and let AI calculate the shares and roast the freeloaders while itâ€™s at it.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

Bill Splitter leverages a language model API (DeepSeek) to generate dynamic, personalized roast comments for each participant based on:
- Total bill amount
- People involved
- The payer
- Roast intensity (Playful or Savage)

The app sends a structured prompt to the LLM API, and then:
- Calculates fair splits
- Retrieves roast replies for each person
- Displays everything in a fun, user-friendly interface

## Setup & Installation

This project is entirely frontend-based and does not require a backend server or complex dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- (Optional) VS Code or any text editor for code modifications
- (Optional) Live Server extension in VS Code for local development

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/31240727/AI-bill-splitter.git
   cd roast-master-bill-splitter

2. **Open the Project:**

Using VS Code: Open the folder in VS Code and run the Live Server extension to preview the application.

Without VS Code: Open the index.html file directly in your web browser 
(note: using Live Server or hosting via a local server is recommended to avoid CORS issues).

3. **Using the App:**

Enter comma-separated names (e.g., Alice, Bob, Charlie).
Input the total bill amount.
Specify the person who paid.
Select your desired roast intensity (Playful or Savage).
Click "Split & Roast" to view the split details and roast comments.


### **Dependencies**
Since this is a frontend-only project, there are no additional package dependencies. The project uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
If you decide to extend the project (e.g., adding a bundler or framework), you can include additional instructions and dependencies here.

### **API Integration Details**
The project simulates a call to the DeepSeek API by making an HTTP POST request to the real DeepSeek endpoint. However, under the hood, it uses a custom function to generate roast comments (ensuring fast and consistent results). The code structure is as follows:
callDeepSeekAPI() Function:
Mimics a DeepSeek API call by preparing a structured prompt and simulating a network delay before returning roast comments.

### **Prompt Engineering:**
The prompt instructs the language model to generate roast comments based on the payer, share, and roast level, ensuring a fun and personalized output.
